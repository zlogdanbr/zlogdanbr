- 👋 Hi, I’m @zlogdanbr
- 👀 I’m interested in C/C++/Python algorithms, and machine learning
- 🌱 I’m currently learning machine learning
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything 
- 📫 How to reach me: message me at github

- I mostly used command line tools and editors either on Linux or Windows ( Notepad++, Vim, or gedit). I hate IDEs
- I recommend that you install notepad++, python, windbg, HXD, WinMerge and git
- Git GUI that comes along with git is good enough to the work we need.
